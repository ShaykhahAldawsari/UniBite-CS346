##UNIBITE :
An online platform that allows female students at Imam
University to explore the university's cafés with comprehensive
information and a virtual tour of each café's interior. We provide
a pre-order and pick-up service from the cafés. In collaboration
with the Yamama service within the university, a delivery service
will also be available.
A section for visitor reviews.
We offer a filtering service to highlight the newest and latest
cafés.
